## Project Description

In this game, the user uses their Pokemon to fight and catch other wild Pokemon, which the user can also use if successfully caught. Pokemon are associated with different types of types and abilities, and their stats depend on their level. At each step/screen of the game, the user can select between different options. The goal of the user is to continually level up their Pokemon through battles with CPUs and eventually catch every Pokemon in this game.

 ## Installation/Usage
 Our program is terminal based, therefore to play our Pokemon role-playing game, the user will need to run the executable. Users are free to pick any option displayed on the terminal. 
 ## Testing
To test our program, we made unit tests for each function to make sure all our functions worked correctly. We also used valgrind to check for memory allocation.
